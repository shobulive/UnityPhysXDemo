# UnityPhysX Demo

Simple game built in the live coding session of my techtalk for demostration of basics of **_PhysX_**, **_Camera Angles_**, **_Lightning_** and **_Rendering_** using **_Unity3D_**.
This game is a simple roller game  where you have to balance the give object(s) on the target for as long as you can.
